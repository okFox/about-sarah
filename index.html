        <h3>Past</h3>
        <p>I love to travel.  I have engineered my entire life to get me to as many places as possible.  I have been to 46 countries and all 7 continents.  My favorites were Vietnam, Antarctica, and the Ngorogoro Crater in Tanzania. </p>

        <h3>Future</h3>
        <p>I am trying to get in shape to go snowboarding. I went once for a week in Breckenridge, CO about a decade ago. I have a bunch of personal training sessions purchased to give me a jumpstart.</p>

        <h3>Present</h3>
        <p>My cat's name is Whiskey. She is 18 years old and doesn't have any teeth.  I inherited her from my mom last year.  She is most definitely the queen of the castle.</p>
